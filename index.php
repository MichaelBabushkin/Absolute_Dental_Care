                         <h3>DENTAL IMPLANTS</h3>
                         <p>Teeth implants usually consist of three parts:

                              The implant screw: Gets permanently attached to your jaw, serving as the root for new
                              teeth.

                              The abutment: A connector that gets attached to the implant, holds the new tooth or a set
                              of teeth.

                              The crown: A prosthetic tooth that will be visible.

                              Dental implants are replacement teeth made from medical-grade titanium alloy which is a
                              metal that is highly biocompatible with your body. Our leading dentists will surgically
                              insert and fuse the implant post into the jawbone, artificially replacing a real tooth
                              root.

                              Once the post integrates and bonds with the bone around it (osseointegration), the
                              abutment gets installed, which will hold the crown. Then, our skilled periodontist will
                              cap the post and abutment with a tooth-colored, natural-looking dental crown, dentures or
                              bridges.

                              Artificial teeth will help you smile more, speak more clearly, and chew better.</p>

                         <h3>TEETH WHITENING</h3>
                         <p>Teeth whitening procedures are used to brighten the appearance of a patient’s smile –
                              sometimes
                              by as many as 5 to 10 shades in a single session. According to the American Dental
                              Association,
                              teeth whitening procedures have become some of the most popular aesthetic dental
                              treatments among patients throughout the country.
                              Professional teeth whitening services can be performed in an office setting or prescribed
                              for take-home use by a patient.
                              In comparison to over-the-counter teeth whitening treatments, professional whitening uses
                              stronger whitening agents
                              that deliver faster and more effective results.</p>

                              root.

                              Once the post integrates and bonds with the bone around it (osseointegration), the
                              abutment gets installed, which will hold the crown. Then, our skilled periodontist will
                              cap the post and abutment with a tooth-colored, natural-looking dental crown, dentures or
                              bridges.

                              Artificial teeth will help you smile more, speak more clearly, and chew better.</p>

                         <p>Teeth implants usually consist of three parts:

                              The implant screw: Gets permanently attached to your jaw, serving as the root for new
                              teeth.

                              The abutment: A connector that gets attached to the implant, holds the new tooth or a set
                              of teeth.

                              The crown: A prosthetic tooth that will be visible.

                              Dental implants are replacement teeth made from medical-grade titanium alloy which is a
                              metal that is highly biocompatible with your body. Our leading dentists will surgically
                              insert and fuse the implant post into the jawbone, artificially replacing a real tooth
                              root.

                              Once the post integrates and bonds with the bone around it (osseointegration), the
                              abutment gets installed, which will hold the crown. Then, our skilled periodontist will

                                   <p>I was treated by few dentists and left them for different reasons before I've
                                        entered office of Dr.Gelman in Bay Ridge. She is caring knowledgeable doctor,
                                        perfectionist, stays with her patients often late to be sure that treatment
                                        completed. Recently I had a severe toothache happend just before my vacation and
                                        Doctor Gelman came from home an hour earlier her schedule to help me. I used
                                        different dental insurances, some of them didn't pay well at all, but Dr.Gelman
                                        always asked for reasonable price. All her fillings, root canals and crowns are
                                        still in perfect condition. She is a doctor for me and my family for more than
                                        10 years.</p>

                                   <h3><a href="news-detail.html">''Feels like home''</a></h3>
                                   <p>Recently I have been searching for a new dentist in the area as I travel a bit and
                                        spend a decent amount of time in nyc. I have searched and searched and searched
                                        for a decent dentist and it's tough. I've been through some awful dental visits.
                                        BUT after stumbling upon Absolute Dental, I have to say this is the best
                                        cleaning and overall dental visit I have ever had. I was worried about seeing
                                        someone new, but so glad I took the leap and made an appointment. The hygentist
                                        was great and friendly and the dentist made me feel right at home. When seeing a
                                        new dentist the entire experience can be long and drawn out, with new pictures,
                                        etc., but they made it short and sweet and made sure they were keeping to my
                                        schedule and had me out on time. I loved that! And now, I actually look forward
                                        to follow up visits! Trust me, I never thought I would look forward to a dental
                                        appointment. Really appreciate the time they took with me and most importantly
                                        my teeth look great!</p>

                                   <p>I have been through so many dentists that used patients as methods to get money
                                        from insurance companies for pointless procedures. Dr. Gelman not only gave me
                                        the best teeth cleaning I have yet received but was so gentle with my root canal
                                        and multiple fillings. I have high sensitivity to pain and an aversion to
                                        anesthesia ...there isn't a single moment that she didn't reassure my that
                                        everything is okay. Although afterwards I felt some pain, during it was a piece
                                        of cake.</p>

                              visitor request. BrightSmileDesign.com purpose in collecting non-personally identifying

                              user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses

                              telephone email address.</p>
